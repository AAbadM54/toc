At a minimum, please include this information:

* Goals
* Non-goals
* Mailing list information
* The location of meetings / agenda / notes
* Initial interested parties to show that there are multiple people across multiple orgs interested
* The chair(s) and TOC sponsor being explicitly listed so they are discoverable
